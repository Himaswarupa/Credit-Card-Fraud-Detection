# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

Final project for the Building AI course - Building AI course project

## Summary

This project aims to develop an intelligent system that utilizes machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time. By analyzing patterns in historical transaction data, the system can identify suspicious activities and reduce financial losses for both banks and consumers.

## Background

Credit card fraud is a pervasive issue that results in billions of dollars in losses annually. With the rise of online shopping and digital payment systems, the risk of fraud has significantly increased. Detecting fraudulent transactions promptly is essential for preventing financial loss and protecting consumer information. 

Key issues include:

* **Increasing Online Transactions**: The rapid growth of e-commerce exposes consumers and banks to higher risks of fraud.
* **Similarity of Transactions**: Fraudulent transactions can closely resemble legitimate ones, making them difficult to detect.
* **Pressure on Financial Institutions**: Banks must enhance their fraud detection capabilities while maintaining a seamless user experience to prevent customer dissatisfaction.

My motivation for this project arises from a strong interest in cybersecurity and the potential of data science to solve real-world challenges. Ensuring the safety and security of financial transactions is vital for maintaining consumer trust and the integrity of financial institutions.

## How is it used?

The credit card fraud detection system can be implemented by banks and financial institutions to monitor transactions in real-time. 

### Usage Process:

1. **Transaction Monitoring**: The system analyzes every transaction as it occurs, using a predefined set of rules and machine learning algorithms.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Various features, including transaction amount, merchant category, time of transaction, and geographical location, are extracted from each transaction.
3. **Fraud Detection**: The trained model evaluates the transaction's risk level based on historical data, identifying patterns indicative of fraud.
4. **Alert Generation**: If a transaction is flagged as suspicious, the system generates an alert for further investigation by fraud analysts.

### Users:

The primary users of this system include:

* **Financial Institutions**: Banks and credit card companies that need to monitor transactions for fraud.
* **Consumers**: End-users who benefit from enhanced security measures protecting their financial information.

## Data sources and AI methods

The data for this project typically comes from historical transaction records provided by financial institutions, which include both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

### Data Sources:

* **Historical Transaction Data**: Data collected from financial institutions that include transaction details, such as amounts, timestamps, and merchant information.
* **Public Datasets**: Open datasets available online, such as the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud) which contains transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.

### AI Techniques:

1. **Supervised Learning**: 
   - Algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) are employed to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on labeled training data.
   - Neural Networks can also be utilized, especially deep learning models for complex pattern recognition.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: 
   - Techniques like clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) are used to identify outliers in the transaction data without labeled examples, which can indicate potentially fraudulent activity.

3. **Ensemble Methods**: 
   - Combining multiple models (e.g., stacking or blending) to improve overall accuracy and reduce the likelihood of false positives.

## Challenges

While the credit card fraud detection system can significantly mitigate fraud, several challenges must be considered:

* **Imbalanced Datasets**: Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones, making it challenging for models to learn effectively. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) may be employed to address this issue.
* **False Positives**: The model may incorrectly flag legitimate transactions as fraudulent, leading to customer dissatisfaction and lost business.
* **Adapting to New Fraud Patterns**: Fraudsters constantly evolve their tactics, requiring regular updates to the model and retraining on new data.
* **Privacy and Security Concerns**: Handling sensitive financial data necessitates strict adherence to regulations such as GDPR and PCI DSS to protect user privacy.

## What next?

Future developments could include:

* **Real-time Monitoring**: Enhancing the system to provide immediate alerts and actions when suspicious transactions are detected.
* **Integration of Additional Data Sources**: Incorporating social media data or user behavioral analytics to improve detection accuracy.
* **Collaboration with Financial Institutions**: Partnering with banks to validate the model and improve its performance in real-world scenarios.
* **User-Friendly Interfaces**: Developing dashboards for fraud analysts to review flagged transactions easily and take appropriate actions.
